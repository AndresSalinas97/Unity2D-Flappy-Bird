Unity's Platform Dependent Compilation feature was used so you can control the flappy bird by pressing the spacebar if you are on a computer or by tapping the touchscreen if you are on a mobile device.

Go download the .apk (for Android) or .app (for MacOS) from the [releases page](https://github.com/AndresSalinas97/Unity2D-Flappy-Bird/releases) and try it out!!
