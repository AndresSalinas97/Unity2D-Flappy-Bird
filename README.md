# Unity2D Flappy Bird

**Final assignment for the "Interfaces and Peripherals" course**

Recreation of the Flappy Bird game made with Unity2D.

It's meant to be built for (and has been tested on) Android, but it also works on Unity Editor or Standalone Apps (PC/Mac/Linux) and should work on iOS.

Unity's Platform Dependent Compilation feature was used so you can control the flappy bird by pressing the spacebar if you are on a computer or by tapping the touchscreen if you are on a mobile device.

*_Made with Unity 2019.2.17f1_*
